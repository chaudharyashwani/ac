		<h1>Air Conditioner Buying Guide</h1>
		<p>
			When the weather heats up, thoughts turn to chilling out. If central air conditioning isn’t an option, room air conditioners can be an inexpensive and energy-efficient alternative for cooling one or two rooms.
			If you’re ready to beat the heat, you aren’t alone: More than 8 million room air conditioners were shipped for sale in 2017. The typical household spends 13 percent of its annual utility bill on cooling, according to Energy Star. So it’s important to choose the right unit. An air conditioner that’s too small will struggle to cool a room. One that’s too big cools so quickly that it doesn’t have time to remove enough moisture, leaving you with a cold, clammy space.

		<h3>How We Test Room ACs</h3>
		<p>
			At Consumer Reports we test room air conditioners in a special climate-controlled chamber. We test three sizes of window ACs—small, medium, and large—and adjust the size of the chamber to the room size appropriate for each air conditioner. We crank the temperature in the chamber up to 90° F, then measure how long it takes the AC to lower the temperature by 15° F. We also gauge how well the AC holds the set temperature. And because noisy air conditioners can be annoying, we measure how loud each unit is on the lowest and highest settings.
